              Oz Foundation has been helping scholars since 2004. We are a
              family foundation that strongly believes a college education is
              the gateway to a successful future. We feel that financial
              hardship should not deter individuals from reaching this goal.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
              Oz Foundation operates in Santa Clara and San Diego Counties,
              supporting students who would otherwise not afford college. In
              addition to financial support, we provide mentorship to help
              students in their studies and adjustment to college life.
