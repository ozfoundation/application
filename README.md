The homepage to host the Oz Foundation application form download.

This is the official repository for the website to host the Oz Foundation application form.

To update the application file:
* Name the file you wish to upload "oz-application.pdf".
* Make sure you are signed in to GitHub.
* Open the "files" directory.
* Click the "Add file" drop-down and select "Upload files".
* Drag the "application.pdf" from your computer into the upload.  You can click the X to cancel any files that were accidentally placed in the upload.
* In the "Commit changes" section, you can write a description of the file you are uploading, like "2023 Application".  This is just for the change to be clear in the commit history.
* Click "Commit changes"
* You should get taken back to the repository's home page.  The website is re-deploying, and may take a few minutes to update.
